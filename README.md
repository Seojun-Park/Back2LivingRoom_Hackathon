# Back2LivingRoom_Hackathon

### Description
42Network and 42 Entrepreneurs are proud to present their first global and online hackathon: “Back to the living room”.

Covid-19 has sent us all back to our living room which turned into an office for most of us. The coworkers we used to see everyday are now pixels on our screen. We need the best tools to make our new workplace, a better place to work. What do you think of developing the ultimate solution for a remote worker?

You can come with your own team or find amazing people to collaborate with – your goal is to develop an MVP (minimum viable product) to help businesses work better remotely. It is open to everyone, whereas you are a student, an alumni of 42 or if a friend of yours wishes to participate.


## Hospital Price Transparency
H.P.T is a project that was awarded in the 42 global campus hackathon in the Tech for Senior category. This project is a web application that compares the prices of medical services provided by hospitals in the US.
